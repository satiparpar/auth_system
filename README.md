Hi there,
Its a authentication and authorization system written by Django.
In this code there are 6 kinds of users (superusers/ staff users/ golden users/ silvern users/ normal users/ not registered users ) that you can limit them by their role.
Its totally free and you can user it for your website.
Of course it needs more customisations according your website.
If you got any question feel free to get in touch with me : satiparpar.com
